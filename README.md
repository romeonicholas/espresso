## About

Your Best Shots is a great way to dial in your espresso pulls. Log your shots so that you can easily make adjustments as needed, without forgetting what you changed. Create your setup by adding your espresso machines, grinders, and even beans to your account, then using those to generate new shot entries with all the nitty gritty details that led to your successes and failures.
